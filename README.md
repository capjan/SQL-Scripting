# SQL Scripting

![Build-Badge](https://github.com/capjan/SQL-Scripting/workflows/.NET%208/badge.svg)

This library provides SQL code generation from code.

It's a still work in progress project, not jet complete - so please don't even think about using this library in production environments.

# Getting Started

* Install SQL Scripting via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cap.SqlScripting/0.1.0-alpha) (Package **Cap.SqlScripting**)
